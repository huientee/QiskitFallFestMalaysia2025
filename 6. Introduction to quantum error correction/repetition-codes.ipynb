This tutorial runs the bit-flip code, which is a very simple form of QEC. It demonstrates a dynamic quantum circuit that can protect an encoded qubit from a single bit-flip error, and then evaluates the bit-flip code performance.\n","\n","You can exploit additional ancilla qubits and entanglement to measure *stabilizers* that do not transform encoded quantum information, while still informing you of some classes of errors that might have occurred. A quantum stabilizer code encodes $k$ logical qubits into $n$ physical qubits. Stabilizer codes critically focus on correcting a discrete error set with support from the Pauli group $\\Pi^n$.\n","\n","For more information about QEC, refer to [Quantum Error Correction for Beginners.](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2794)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88672bd6","metadata":{"id":"88672bd6"},"source":["## Requirements\n","\n","Before starting this tutorial, ensure that you have the following installed:\n","\n","*   Qiskit SDK v2.0 or later with visualization support (`pip install qiskit[visualization]`)\n","*   Qiskit Runtime v0.40 or later (`pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime`)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"14c29e8b","metadata":{"id":"14c29e8b"},"source":["## Setup\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install qiskit[visualisation] qiskit_ibm_runtime qiskit_aer pylatexenc -q"],"metadata":{"id":"awSFXRLSr04v"},"id":"awSFXRLSr04v","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1b9fd8ad","metadata":{"id":"1b9fd8ad"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Qiskit imports\n","from qiskit import (\n","    QuantumCircuit,\n","    QuantumRegister,\n","    ClassicalRegister,\n",")\n","\n","# Qiskit Runtime\n","from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler\n","from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeAlgiers\n","from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager\n","from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator\n","\n","fake_algiers = FakeAlgiers()\n","pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=fake_algiers, optimization_level=3)\n","backend=fake_algiers"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4d01e8d3","metadata":{"id":"4d01e8d3"},"source":["## Step 1.
