        "[Shor's algorithm,](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144598347011) developed by Peter Shor in 1994, is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm for factoring integers in polynomial time. Its significance lies in its ability to factor large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, threatening the security of widely used cryptographic systems like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. By efficiently solving this problem on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, Shor's algorithm could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and computational mathematics, underscoring the transformative power of quantum computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, we define the order finding problem and construct corresponding circuits from the quantum phase estimation protocol. Next, we run the order finding circuits on real hardware using shortest-depth circuits we can transpile. The last section completes Shor's algorithm by connecting the order finding problem to integer factorization.\n",

Therefore, these states are perfectly distinguishable, and we can rotate the basis they form back to the computational basis to make a measurement. A mathematical analysis shows that this rotation matrix corresponds to the inverse quantum Fourier transform (qFT) in $2^m$-dimensional Hilbert space. The intuition behind this is that the periodic structure of the modular exponentiation operators is encoded in the quantum state, and the qFT converts this periodicity into measurable peaks in the frequency domain."

Recall that the phase we measured is $k / r$, where $a^r \\; (\\textrm{mod} \\; N) = 1$ and $k$ is a random integer between $0$ and $r - 1$. From this equation, we have $(a^r - 1) \\; (\\textrm{mod} \\; N) = 0,$ which means $N$ must divide $a^r-1$. If $r$ is also even, then we can write $a^r -1 = (a^{r/2}-1)(a^{r/2}+1).$ If $r$ is not even, we cannot go further and must try again with a different value for $a$; otherwise, there is a high probability that the greatest common divisor of $N$ and either $a^{r/2}-1$, or $a^{r/2}+1$ is a proper factor of $N$.\n",
